# guessing-game
A guessing game by Langston McClarron.

This guessing game utilizes the 'if', 'else if', 'else' function to provide answers to the responses of the visitor of the website.

These additions also give the site more life with an extra question as well as logging the answers that the user got correct. At the end of the site there is a prompt that tells them how many they got right out of 5!

I utilized both my teacher and TA to help build this site.
