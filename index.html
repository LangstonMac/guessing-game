    <p>A little bit about myself, my name is Langston McClarron. I was named after Langston Hughes the famous poet
    from the Harlem Renaissance and to this day am attempting to honor that name. Here you have visited a page where there
    are a few questions about myself. Some of them are self-explanatory while a few others can be more tricky.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will let you know I was born in Seattle, Washington in 1991 on the south side and was raised there. Random fact on
      every birthday I had my family and I would head to the SAME mexican restaurant because I always wanted the same dish; cheese enchiladas.
      That with an ice cold mix of strawberry lemonade would make my day every time. Being born on August 11th the number somewhat
      gravitated to me and i've always been a fan of it. Well, enough about me, I've given you more than enough hints how about
      you try out the game!?</p>
